# Original Dataset
* 80 columns and 43,746 rows
* Many rows were missing values. The smallest number of non-null values was around 2000
* Data on CO2 levels for 162 countries and the world as a whole
* CO2 output for different sectors like trade, oil, gas, coal, and cement 
* Date ranges were from 1850 - 2023

# Trimmed Dataset
* 5 columns and 10,980 rows
* years were limited from 1950-2023 to use more accurate and relevant data
* all NA values were dropped from the columns used


# Basic Information
```{python}
#| label: info
#| include: true

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("./Data/Data.csv")

# create subset of data
df.dropna(subset=["year", "Name", "gdp", "population", "temperature_change_from_co2", "co2_including_luc"],inplace=True)
df2=df[["year", "Name", "gdp", "population", "co2_including_luc", "temperature_change_from_co2"]].query("year > 1950")

# print basic info
print("shape: ", df2.shape)
print("\n")
print(df2.info())

```
# Summary Statistics

# Key Distributions

# Questions
* Is a higher GDP related to a higher level of CO2 emissions?
* Are the countries with the greatest CO2 emissions the ones experiencing the greatest temperature change from CO2?
* Does a higher population correlate to a higher level of CO2 emissions?
