# Original Dataset
* 80 columns and 43,746 rows
* Many rows were missing values. The smallest number of non-null values was around 2000
* Data on CO2 levels for 162 countries and the world as a whole
* CO2 output for different sectors like trade, oil, gas, coal, and cement 
* Date ranges were from 1850 - 2023

# Trimmed Dataset
* 5 columns and 10,980 rows
* years were limited from 1950-2023 to use more accurate and relevant data
* all NA values were dropped from the columns used

# New Columns
* Year
* Name
* GDP (Gross Domestic Product) 
* Population
* CO2 including LUC (Land Use Change)
* Temperature change from CO2

# What we hope to answer
* Is a higher GDP related to a higher level of CO2 emissions?
* Are the countries with the greatest CO2 emissions the ones experiencing the greatest temperature change from CO2?
* Does a higher population correlate to a higher level of CO2 emissions?
